/*
* Example of type inference in a program with dependent functions: the stratified
* inference will treat first id and then f and g using the obtained type for id
*/

% The inferred type is
% id :: A -> A
id X = X

% The inferred type is
% f :: bool
f = id true

% The inferred type is
% g :: real
g = id 0
